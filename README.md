# Recicropal

Crops and content, mutually reciprocal.

This is a Minecraft mod that focuses on adding crops and other curiosities which 
complements one another. Inspired by a lot of aesthetic, vanilla plus mods out there.
My goal was to bring varied and fresh content starting from sowing some seeds.
I always feel that I need mods that add more depth to farming and agriculture,
but not just by adding a massive amount of kinds of food to work with nor
introducing too huge of a gameplay change.

This mod is intended to be played with other mods so feel free to add this to your modpacks!

Wiki and more content is slowly being developed.
